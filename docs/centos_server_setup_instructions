Following are the steps we followed to get this installed in a Cent OS machine.

Install packages
================

yum install git
yum install mysql-server mysql
yum install mysql-devel
yum install curl-devel
yum install pcre-devel


Ruby setup
==========

rvm install (curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable)
ruby install with rvm ( rvm install ruby-2.0.0-p247 --verify-downloads 1)
rvm gemset create ruby-2.0.0-p24@openlibrary
gem install passenger

Deploy
======

Now, add the IP to deploy script (config/deploy.rb)

cap deploy

NOTE: You might have to create following directories, if they don't exist
mkdir -p  /u/apps/openlibrary/shared/pids
mkdir /u/apps/openlibrary/shared/log

cap deploy:start

Hit the server ip. Open library should be running now :)
